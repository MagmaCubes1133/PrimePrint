# PrimePrint
A program to print prime numbers until a user specified limit.
This program is made in an easy to understand way by utilizing a fucntion to check if a number is prime or not and then the function is 
implemented into the main program to print prime numbers until the limit.
This is my first program on github so feel free to suggest changes to help it give output in a lesser time.
